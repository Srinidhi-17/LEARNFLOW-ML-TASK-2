Project Title:
Traffic Sign Recognition using CNN

Project Description:
This project focuses on training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for recognizing traffic signs. It utilizes a dataset of traffic sign images, preprocesses the data, and trains a CNN model for classification.

Technologies Used:
Python,
NumPy,
scikit-learn,
TensorFlow,
Keras.

Requirements:
Python 3.x,
NumPy,
scikit-learn,
TensorFlow,
Keras.

Installation Instructions:Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
